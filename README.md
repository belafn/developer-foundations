# Developer Foundations

This repository documents my technical training in software development.

It is structured as a learning timeline, focused on building strong foundations, professional organization, and good version control practices from the start.

The goal is to clearly and progressively record my technical growth in the technology field.

- `00-introduction` — Project context, objectives, and methodology  
- `01-fundamentals` — Core foundations (Git/GitHub and programming logic)  
- `02-front-end` — Front-end development *(planned)*  
- `03-back-end` — Back-end development *(planned)*
