# Week 01 — JavaScript Fundamentals

This directory contains my first week of hands-on JavaScript practice, focusing on core language concepts and basic interaction with the runtime environment.

The goal of this week was to build familiarity with syntax, execution flow, and fundamental debugging techniques.

## Topics covered

### 01. Console basics
Introduction to using the console for output, understanding how JavaScript communicates information during execution.

### 02. Variables
Study of variable declaration, assignment, and basic data storage using JavaScript.

### 03. Template strings
Usage of template literals to build dynamic strings and improve code readability.

### 04. Simulation
Simple simulations to practice logical reasoning, variable interaction, and sequential execution.

### 05. Debugging
Basic debugging techniques, including inspecting values, tracing execution flow, and identifying errors.

## Notes

All files in this directory were created for learning purposes and represent incremental progress during the first week of study.
