# Developer Foundations

This repository documents my technical training in software development, organized as a learning timeline.

The focus is on building strong foundations while following professional standards for version control, documentation, and code organization from the start.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into progressive stages:

- `00-introduction`  
  Project context, objectives, and study methodology.

- `01-fundamentals`  
  Core technology and programming foundations, including:
  - Git and GitHub
  - Programming logic

- `02-front-end`  
  Front-end development foundations. *(planned)*

- `03-back-end`  
  Back-end development foundations. *(planned)*

- `04-databases`  
  Database concepts and practices. *(planned)*

- `05-projects`  
  Practical projects integrating acquired knowledge. *(planned)*

## Methodology

- Incremental learning
- Continuous documentation
